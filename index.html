            I am a first-year student attending the Multimedia Production
            Program at Lethbridge Polytechnic with the intention of turning my
            passion for creativity into a professional career. Ever since I
            could remember creating things, and making art has always brought
            me so much happiness that not a lot of other things did. Other
            than being able to express myself in ways you can’t really with
            words, letting my creativity spiral has helped me ground myself.
            and feel more connected from within. Every year I love taking on
            new hobbies and growing my abilities. Throughout my life I have
            taken on a variety of different mediums like painting, drawing,
            sculpting, felting, woodburning, and drawing digitally on my iPad.
            I would love to be able to take my skills and turn them into a
            living where I can create things that not only I would love and
            be proud of but also the people I would be working with.

            I consider myself to be an incredibly strong and resilient individual. As someone who loved school as a young
            girl, High school was harder than I thought. I had a rather rough
            upbringing, but I am so proud of my younger self for facing the
            challenges that no young teenage girl should have to face. I
            was able to power through and graduate while really struggling
            with bullying and mental health. I came out stronger and became
            the person who I am today, which I would consider one of my
            greatest accomplishments. When I was younger, I also loved theatre and took part in a handful of community
            musical productions. In
            the 6th grade, I played one of the lead roles “<a
              href="https://seuss.fandom.com/wiki/Gertrude_McFuzz">Gertrude Mcfuzz</a>”, in <a
              href="https://seuss.fandom.com/wiki/Seussical_the_Musical" target="_blank">Seussical the Muscical</a>
            that. I had to sing
            around 6 solos, which I don’t think I could ever do now.

            This gallery represents a handful of the projects I’m very proud of from the past few years. Even though I
            don’t always have much time for art outside of school, I try to bring creativity into everything I work on.
            Every project has been a chance for me to learn, grow, and express a little piece of how I see the world.

            Growing up, I was raised by my mom, who I would consider my best friend. I was born on
            Vancouver Island then moved to Clearwater, BC. Eventually, decided to settle in Creston. I grew up with my
            older and younger brothers. For the majority of my life, I have looked up to my older brother Quin, who has
            been a major creative inspiration.
          </p>

          <p>
            Animals have always held a special place in my heart. I have helped rehabilitate a family of baby skunks,
            raising them to adulthood before releasing them back into the wild, and assisted in fostering baby kittens.
            In September 2023, I adopted a puppy. Though not having set plans for the future yet, I wasn’t sure if it
            was
            the best idea. Little did I know that sweet, little miracle pup Gypsy was everything I ever needed. Before
            moving to Lethbridge for school, I would spend a lot of my free time going on adventures and hikes around
            the
            area with my fluffy best friend. My love for family and animals influences the way I approach my work, with
            care, patience, and a sense of gratitude.
